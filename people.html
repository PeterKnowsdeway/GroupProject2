   <h1>People</h1>
   <p>About four-fifths of the population are Gibraltarians, which includes those born in Gibraltar before 1925 and their descendants, as well as the spouses of Gibraltarians.
     The remainder are resident aliens and the families of British military personnel. Most Gibraltarians are of mixed Genoese, British, Spanish, Maltese, and Portuguese descent.
     Moroccans and Indians predominate among the resident aliens.
   </p>
   <p>About four-fifths of Gibraltarians are Roman Catholic.
     The Anglican bishopric also covers communities in southern Europe, mainly in Costa del Sol of Spain. The small Jewish community is of Sephardic descent.
     English is the official language of government and education, though most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish, and many speak an English dialect known as Yanito (Llanito), which is influenced by Spanish, Genoese, and Hebrew.
